# Getting Started

[placeholder]

## Install Tracker from NPM

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>

    yarn add @objectiv/tracker-browser

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

    npm install @objectiv/tracker-browser

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

    pnpm add @objectiv/tracker-browser

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure Tracker

The tracker should be configured as early as possible. Ideally outside of the Application or high up in the components tree.

Here is how that can be achieved in the `index` of the Application, right before rendering the App.

```typescript
â€¦
import { configureTracker } from "@objectiv/tracker-browser";

configureTracker({
  applicationId: 'app-id',
  endpoint: 'https://collector.application.dev'
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### No `index` access?
Any high-up enough component will do as well. Think of `App`, `Layout`, `Root` or equivalent components.

In such cases it's a good idea to stabilize `configureTracker` by wrapping it in a [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) without dependencies. This will ensure it will be unaffected by re-renders.


```typescript
useEffect(
  () => {
    configureTracker({
      applicationId: 'app-id',
      endpoint: 'https://collector.application.dev'
    });
  },
  [] // no dependencies => no re-renders
)
```


:::info
Executing `configureTracker` multiple times is not an issue from a tracking point of view. It's simply not efficient.

## Done
The tracker should now be running and auto-tracking some Events already, such as ApplicationLoaded and URLChange.

Time to start [Tracking some Locations](/tracking/how-to-guides/tracking-locations.mdx)!
