# AbstractGlobalContext

GlobalContexts are used to populate Trackers or Events with `global_contexts` properties. They carry 
information that is not related to where the Event originated, such as device, platform or business data.

See [Global Contexts](/docs/taxonomy/global-contexts) for all Contexts that inherit from AbstractGlobalContext.
