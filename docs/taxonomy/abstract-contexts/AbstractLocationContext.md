# AbstractLocationContext

This is the abstract parent of all Location Contexts. LocationContexts are used to populate a Tracker's or 
Event's `location_stack` properties. A Location Stack is meant to describe accurately where an Event 
originated in the UI, e.g. Sections, Menus, etc.

See [Location Contexts](/docs/taxonomy/location-contexts) for all Contexts that inherit from AbstractGlobalContext.

### Properties
