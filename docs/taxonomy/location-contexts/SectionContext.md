# SectionContext

SectionContexts are special LocationContexts representing a logical area of the UI or the system. They can be 
often reasoned about as being containers of other LocationContexts but not the direct targets of Events.

### Properties
All inherited from [AbstractLocationContext](/docs/taxonomy/location-contexts#abstractlocationcontext).
