<h1>Core Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#core-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h1>
<p>Bach aims to make life for the DS as simple and powerful as possible by using a very familiar interface. We
use two main concepts to achieve that.</p>
<section id="delayed-database-operations">
<h2>Delayed database operations<a class="headerlink" href="#delayed-database-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Regular operations on DataFrames and Series do not trigger any operations on the database nor do they
transfer any data from the database to Bach. All operations are combined and compiled to a single SQL query,
which is executed only when one of a few specific data-transfer functions is called on either a DataFrame or
a Series object:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame.to_pandas()</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame.head()</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>The property accessors <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame.values</span></code>, <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series.array</span></code> and
<code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series.value</span></code> (Series only),</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Typical usage would be to do all heavy lifting inside the database, and only query the aggregated/summarized
output.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with pandas<a class="headerlink" href="#compatibility-with-pandas" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We are striving for a pandas compatible api, such that everyone that already knows pandas can get started
with Bach in mere minutes.</p>
<p>However there are differences between Bach&#8217;s API and pandas&#8217;s API. Pandas is a big product, and it has a lot
of functionality that we have not yet implemented. Additionally we have some functions that pandas doesn&#8217;t
have, and some of our functions have slightly different parameters.</p>
<p>Of course the fundamental difference is in how data is stored and processed: in local memory vs in the
database. This also results in a few differences in how DataFrames form both libraries work in certain
situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The order of rows in a Bach DataFrame can be non-deterministic. If there is not a deterministic
<code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame.sort_values()</span></code> call, then the order of the rows that the data-transfer
functions return can be unpredictable.</p></li>
<li><p>Bach DataFrames can distinguish between <cite>NULL</cite>/<cite>None</cite> and Not-a-Number (<cite>NaN</cite>). Pandas generally doesn&#8217;t
and mainly uses NaN. When outputting data from a Bach DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame, most of this
distinction is lost again.</p></li>
<li><p>In a Bach DataFrame column names must be unique, in pandas this is not the case</p></li>
</ul>
