<p>Bach is Objectiv&#8217;s data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like
dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the
full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. It includes a set of operations that
enable effective feature creation for datasets that embrace the open taxonomy of analytics.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a online <a class="reference external" href="https://notebook.objectiv.io/lab?path=product_analytics.ipynb">sandboxed notebook</a>
with Objective Analytics data for you to play around, to demonstrate what Bach can do without the need to
install anything. Beware this is python compiled to javascript, running in the browser; so the performance
is not the same as running Bach in a normal python notebook. Especially the initial loading can be slow.</p>

<h2>What is Bach?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-bach" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Bach is a library for analysing data that is stored in a SQL database. Currently we only support Postgres,
but we plan on supporting more databases. We&#8217;re using an interface that&#8217;s mostly compatible with <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html">pandas</a>. All data storage and
processing is handled by the database. As a result, local memory does not limit the size of the data that
can be analysed with Bach.</p>
<p>The two main data classes of Bach are the DataFrame and Series:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="dataframe/bach.DataFrame.html#bach.DataFrame" title="bach.DataFrame"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code></a> represents data in a tabular form, with all rows having the same
columns, and each column having a specific data type and a distinct name.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="series/bach.Series.html#bach.Series" title="bach.Series"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series</span></code></a> object represents a single column in a DataFrame, with
different subclasses per data type that allow for type specific operations.</p></li>
</ul>
