# docusaurus doesn't create proper directory indexes. This takes care of the following case:
#
# /docs/modeling/ -> /docs/modeling.html
# as othwerwise it would show a directory index.

RewriteEngine On
# make sure the request ends in /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^.*?/$
# only do this if there's no index.html on disk
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}index.html !-f
# good to go, rewrite
RewriteRule ^(.*?)/$   $1.html [L]
