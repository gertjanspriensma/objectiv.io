Objectiv comes with an open model hub that contains a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models. It includes models for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases.

All models are compatible with any dataset that embraces the [open analytics taxonomy](/taxonomy/introduction.md). The source is available for all models and youâ€™re free to make any changes. You can use the included pandas-compatible [Bach modeling library](/modeling/intro.mdx) to customize them, or even add in advanced ML models.

Each model can run on an [Objectiv Bach DataFrame](/modeling/dataframe/bach.DataFrame.mdx) and delivers output in this format as well, so it can be used for further modeling.

:::info WIP
We've setup an intial showcase of the available product analytics models in our [live demo notebook](https://notebook.objectiv.io/lab/?path=product_analytics.ipynb). Right now, we are creating functions for each of these models, so you can easily use then from a notebook.
:::

## Available models
* `conversion` Unique users that reach a defined conversion feature
* `conversion_funnel` Sequence of events before a conversion
* `retention` Percentage of users retained per cohort
* `features_per_user` Amount of users for each product feature
* `frequency` Users categorized by number of total sessions
* `recency` Mean number of days before users return
* `session_duration` Mean session duration
* `duration_between_events` Mean session duration between specific defined events
* `bounce_rate` Sessions with only a single hit
* `unique_users` Unique users
* `new_users` New users, with a specific timerange to define new users on
* `sessions` Unique sessions
* `sessions_per_user` Average number of sessions per user
* <i>... and many more to come</i>

## Model parameters
Each of the available models can run on a desired set of common parameters that define:
* time range
* time aggregation
* user app
* feature selection

Each model has also specific parameters than can be used to customize, for example which event defines conversion.

## Stacking models
Each model can run before or after any of the available other models. This allows you stack them for your analysis and further ML.

## Export to BI
Once you are done building a model, you can export to your favorite open-source BI tool with a single command. Right now, we support [Lightdash](https://www.lightdash.com/), with more to come.
