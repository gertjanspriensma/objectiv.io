## Welcome to the official Objectiv documentation
Objectiv is a complete, self-hosted product analytics stack designed for
effective data modeling and exploration with minimal gruntwork.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/objectiv-stack.svg')} alt="The Objectiv Stack" className="img-l" />

It includes everything you need to answer common product analytics questions now, while
providing a solid foundation for in-depth analysis & machine learning down the road.

### Highlights
* Collect [model-ready data](/tracking/core-concepts) that doesn't require cleaning and transformation
* Ensure compatibility with many models by validating against an [open analytics taxonomy](/taxonomy)
* Build reusable models with [Pandas-like modeling](/modeling) that runs on the full dataset
* Chain together custom & [pre-built models](/open-model-hub) to answer in-depth questions quickly

Check out [objectiv.io](https://www.objectiv.io) to learn more.
