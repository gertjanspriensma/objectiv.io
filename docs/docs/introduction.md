## Welcome to the official Objectiv documentation
Objectiv is a data collection & modeling library that puts the data scientist first. It is built around 
[the open taxonomy of analytics](/taxonomy/introduction.md), which is our proposal for a common way to collect, 
structure and validate data. With Objectiv, you create a 
[contextual layer for your application](tracking/core-concepts/overview.md) by mapping it to the taxonomy, 
with the goal of collecting better data and more effective modeling.

With [Objectiv Bach](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) (our data modeling library), you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations on your full SQL dataset. It includes extensions for effective feature creation for datasets that embrace the [taxonomy](/taxonomy).

Check out [objectiv.io](https://www.objectiv.io) to learn more.

## Getting Started

1. [Play with Objectiv](https://notebook.objectiv.io/lab?path=product_analytics.ipynb) in our Live Demo Notebook
2. [Test drive Objectiv locally](/quickstart-guide) with a fully functional demo pipeline

## Running Objectiv in production
A detailed How-to guide is coming soon.
