# Introduction

Objectiv's open taxonomy of analytics is a proposal for a common way to collect, structure, and validate data. It defines classes for each common event type and the contexts in which they can happen. It also describes
their properties, requirements, and relationships with other classes.

Using the open taxonomy ensures models & data can be reused, and data scientists can build on the knowledge 
and practices of others.

## Core Concepts
To understand in more detail how the Taxonomy works, read about the underlying core concepts.

## Reference
To implement the taxonomy, all Contexts and Events are open and documented.
