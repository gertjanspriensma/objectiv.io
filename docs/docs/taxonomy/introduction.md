# Introduction

The open Taxonomy is [our](https://objectiv.io/about/) proposal for a common way to collect, structure, and 
validate analytics data. It is designed to cover a wide range of common analytics use cases. 

We aim to tackle the problems that most data scientists face: 
* Having to spend a significant amount of time on prepwork to ensure data is ready for modeling; and
* Having to usually build models from scratch, because there is no common way to structure data or share 
  models - even though data teams often have very similar goals.

The taxonomy covers:
* An initial set of classes for common event types for analytics, and the context in which they can happen; and
* Their properties, requirements, and relationships.

Objectiv also provides [tracking](/tracking/introduction.md), 
[collecting](/tracking/core-concepts/collector.md), and 
[modeling](/modeling) implementations that fully build on the taxonomy.

**We're actively looking for feedback**: Just like the rest of the code, the taxonomy is open source and 
we're building it in public. If you have any ideas or opinions on where to take it next, please see our 
[Contribution Guide](/the-project/contributing.md).
