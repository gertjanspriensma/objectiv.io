# Introduction

The open Taxonomy is [our](https://objectiv.io/about/) proposal for a common way to collect, structure, and 
validate analytics data. It is designed to cover a wide range of common analytics use cases. It provides:
* An initial set of classes for common event types for analytics, and the context in which they can happen; and
* Their properties, requirements, and relationships.

Objectiv also provides [tracking](/tracking/introduction.md), 
[collecting](/tracking/core-concepts/collector.md), and 
[modeling](/modeling) implementations that fully build on the taxonomy.

**We're actively looking for feedback**: Just like the rest of the code, the taxonomy is open source and 
we're building it in public. If you have any ideas or opinions on where to take it next, please see our 
[Contribution Guide](/the-project/contributing.md).

## Core Concepts
To understand in more detail how the Taxonomy works, read about the underlying core concepts.
