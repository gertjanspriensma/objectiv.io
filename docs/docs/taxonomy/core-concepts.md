# Taxonomy Core Concepts

import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';

The Open Analytics Taxonomy consists of:
* Classes for each common analytics event type, called Events.
* The Contexts in which they happen.
* Their properties, requirements and inheritance.

## GlobalContexts
[GlobalContexts](/taxonomy/global-contexts/) add general information to an [Event](/taxonomy/events/). 

## LocationContexts
[LocationContexts](/taxonomy/location-contexts/) are meant to describe where an [Event](/taxonomy/events/) originated from in the visual UI. 

## Events
Describe interactive and non-interactive [Events](/taxonomy/events/).
