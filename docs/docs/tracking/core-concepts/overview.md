# Tracking Core Concepts

While most trackers simply track everything by inserting a simple script, the data they collect is often incomplete or overcomplete, unstructured and ambiguous. Significant gruntwork is typically required before it can be used for modeling. 

Objectiv asks you to map your application to the [open taxonomy of analytics](/taxonomy). This is done by [tagging](/tracking/core-concepts/tagging.md) interactive elements and [locations](/tracking/core-concepts/locations.md) in your applicationâ€™s UI. It will create a contextual layer for your application that Objectiv's tracker uses to collect clean, well-structured data that is ready for modeling with minimal gruntwork. 

#### Learn more about Objectiv's tracking concepts:
* [Tagging](/tracking/core-concepts/tagging.md) of Elements to track.
* [Events](/tracking/core-concepts/events.md) triggered based on tags.
* [Locations](/tracking/core-concepts/locations.md) that describe the exact UI position for an 
  [Event](/tracking/core-concepts/events.md).
* [Visibility](/tracking/core-concepts/visibility.md) Events to track whether Elements are shown/hidden.
* [Trackers](/tracking/core-concepts/trackers.md) to instrument on various platforms.
* [Validation](/tracking/core-concepts/validation.md) of Events according to the 
  [Taxonomy](//taxonomy/introduction.md).
* [Collector](/tracking/core-concepts/validation.md) to receive, validate and store 
  [Events](/tracking/core-concepts/events.md).
