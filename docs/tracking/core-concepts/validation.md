Data tracked by Objectiv adheres to an open, standardized [Taxonomy](/taxonomy/overview.md). This means it's 
well-structured & self-descriptive, and can be validated at the first step of the pipeline. Objectiv provides 
several tools to catch errors before data starts flowing in, outlined below.

## Validation in IDE
TODO: inline JS docs, typed tagging & tracking calls, etc.

## Debugging in browser console
TODO; errors, uniqueness

## Logging in browser console
TODO. Or custom written logger

## Validation by Collector
TODO. For more background, see [Collector docs](./collector.md).
