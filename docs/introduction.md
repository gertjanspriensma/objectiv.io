:::

Objectiv is a product analytics pipeline thatâ€™s built with the data scientist in mind. It features a standardized event taxonomy that enables effective & reusable modeling on the data science side.

Events tracked with Objectiv carry enough context (e.g. location and marketing source) to be uniquely identifiable, while aggregation remains flexible. Event data is validated through the pipeline and is ready for modeling without the typical gruntwork. 

The taxonomy is extensible and enables you to take, build, combine and run reusable models for specific parts of your product. 

## Overview
Below a concise overview of the various areas in Objectiv, with click-throughs to their respective documentation sections.

## VOD example
Throughout the documentation we'll be using examples from our imaginary Video On Demand service: [Rick On Demand](https://rick.objectiv.io), or ROD for short. <small>(no worries, the link is roll-free :))</small>. 

ROD covers a few tracking use cases that many applications  have: sections, navigation, overlays, media, and a funnel.
