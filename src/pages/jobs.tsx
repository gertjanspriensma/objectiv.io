            <p>Objectiv is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our crew, a team of experienced 
              software engineers and data scientists on a mission to create the ultimate workflow for the 
              data scientist.</p>
            <p>After almost a year of hard work, we've just released the first public version of our data 
              collection &amp; modeling library. One of its major components is Bach, a data modeling library 
              that enables you to compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your 
              notebook. It uses an SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and 
              you can output models to SQL with a single command.</p>
            <p>It includes a set of operations that enable effective feature creation for datasets that 
              embrace the open taxonomy of analytics, which is our proposal for a common way to collect, 
              structure and validate data so models &amp; data can be reused, and data scientists can build 
              on the knowledge and practices of others.</p>
            <p>If that excites you, you’ll be glad to hear we have big plans for Bach, and are looking for 
              able hands to help us execute them.</p>

            <h2><img width="32px" src='/img/icons/icon-cap.svg' alt='The team' /> The team</h2>
            <p>You will be joining an early team of 10 analytics enthusiasts that are together building a great 
              product. The lines between data science, data engineering, frontend and ops are quite blurry in 
              our team, as everyone is taking multiple parts of that.</p>

            <h2><img width="32px" src='/img/icons/icon-id-card.svg' alt='About you' /> About you</h2>
            <p>This role is at the intersection of engineering &amp; data science. What we are looking for in 
              this role:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have at least 5 years of working experience in a software engineering role, and are an 
                expert in Python.</li>
              <li>You have strong affinity with the data science side of things; worked actively in notebooks, 
                set up analytics pipelines, created models from scratch, etc.</li>
              <li>You get excited about data engineering tech like dbt or Meltano.</li>
              <li>You have a master’s degree in software engineering, math, physics, data science, or something 
                related.</li>
              <li>You have a can-do attitude. Even when the problem seems huge, you're able to chop it up and 
                solve the chunks.</li>
              <li>You are fluent in English.</li>
              <li>This is a remote role in EU timezone with regular team offsites in The Netherlands.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><img width="32px" src='/img/icons/icon-video-call.svg' alt='Our work setup' /> Our work setup</h2>
            <p>Our team meets in Utrecht every Tuesday. This is the day where we do all the team updates, 
              syncs, and make decisions to move forward together. The rest of the week everyone works remotely 
              and we limit meetings to standups and syncs that cannot wait.</p>
            <p>We don’t care when work is being done, we care about what is being done. So our team is used to 
              taking exercise breaks or spending family time during the day and then getting stuff done in the 
              evening. Things like that.</p>
            <p>On a regular basis we meet for a team offsite and make sure there is always something to 
              celebrate together.</p>

              of experience in analytics and has made it their core focus to build the best possible workflow
